# Pygame-Starter

Hello you not so beautiful people My Names Troy, Python Coder.
and sence some people like me wanna code pygame...
I made a pygame starter with every thing you need!

here are some instructions to get your hands on your toes!(im an idiot)

first, you see 12? well thats player model.
the first 2 digits are where it spawns.(just so you know the maps only 800x600. keep that in mind)
the other two digits are its size you know? LxW. all that good stuff!

you see 18 - 24. know what ill give an example:


 
 
 key = pygame.key.get_pressed()
    if key[pygame.K_a] :
        player.move_ip(-1,0)
    elif key[pygame.K_d] :
        player.move_ip(1,0)
    elif key[pygame.K_w] :
        player.move_ip(0,-1)



you see these are the controls(what does move_ip mean?) GLAD YOU ASKED
move ip stands for Move In Place

now this:
pygame.draw.rect(screen,(0,100,0),player)
this little script makes the player Exist.cool right?

The rest you sure can figure out on your own!
good luck Dumb[CENSORD]
